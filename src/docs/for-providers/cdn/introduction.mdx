### What are CDNs?

A Content Delivery Network, or CDN, is a global network of servers stationed at various data centers purposed to swiftly serve users with digital assets, including web pages, images, videos, and more. The objective of a CDN is to diminish latency, enhance content accessible to users, and achieve this by placing the data in proximity to them.

### About Auto Accept New Deals

When this option is enabled, billing will start immediately after a deal is created and in exchange, clients will expect instant provisioning.

If the option is disabled, you as a provider must manually accept the treatment requested by the client.

In the interface, on both the supplier and customer side, the deal will appear differentiated with an orange icon that means "Awaiting approval."

<ThemedImage
    alt="Offers Pending"

        light: useBaseUrl('/img/providers-guide/offers-pending-light.png'),
