### What are CDNs?

A Content Delivery Network, or CDN, is a global network of servers stationed at various data centers purposed to swiftly serve users with digital assets, including web pages, images, videos, and more. The objective of a CDN is to diminish latency, enhance content accessible to users, and achieve this by placing the data in proximity to them.

### CDNs Offers

The CDN offerings that a user can purchase are services and plans provided by CDN providers that encompass a variety of features and capabilities designed to improve the delivery and performance of digital content.

You can create as many offers as you want to provide CDN services. Each offer can be set up to hold a determined amount of deals. Deals are billed by seconds of usage.


### How to create CDNs offers on the market?

        light: useBaseUrl('/img/providers-guide/marketplace-offers-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/providers-guide/marketplace-offers-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

You must be registered as a provider.

1. Go to **/provider/offers/new** or from the menu **Provider > Add Offer**.
2. Complete the offer form:

    <ThemedImage
        alt="Provider Add Offer Form"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/img/providers-guide/provider-add-offer-light.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/img/providers-guide/provider-add-offer-dark.png'),
        }}
    />

    * **Offer label:** For internal reference only. Clients won't see the offer label through the app.
    * **Minimum Deal Duration:** This refers to the minimum duration that will be billed. If 'Full Period Billing' is enabled, this duration is also used as the billing period.
    * **Maximum Deals:** The maximum number of deals allowed for this offer. Once this limit is reached, no additional deals can be accepted.
    * **Price Per Month:** Fees charged: Marketplace 30%
    * **Full Period Billing:** If this option is enabled, once the minimum deal duration has elapsed, the next billing will cover an entire period equal to the deal's minimum duration.
    * **Auto Accept New Deals:** When this option is enabled, billing will start immediately after a deal is created and in exchange, clients will expect instant provisioning.
    * **Custom CNAMEs:** Allow clients to use their own CNAMEs with your CDN.
    * **Automatic SSL Certificates:** Provide free SSL certificate auto-negotiation for client CNAMEs.
    * **API Endpoint:** This is the endpoint where your clients will retrieve and post data. The protocol (https / http) is required.
    * **Node Locations:** Specify the location of your edge nodes.
    * **Bandwidth Limits:** 
      * **Max Burst Speed** 
      * **Bandwidth Amount:** Use 0 for unlimited.
      * **Unit** 
      * **Period**
3. Once the form is completed, you must submit it and confirm the transaction in your wallet. You will be redirected to your offers section. This is how it looks:

        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/img/providers-guide/offers-section-light.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/img/providers-guide/offers-section-dark.png'),
        }}
    />

### About Auto Accept New Deals

When this option is enabled, billing will start immediately after a deal is created and in exchange, clients will expect instant provisioning.

If the option is disabled, you as a provider must manually accept the treatment requested by the client.

In the interface, on both the supplier and customer side, the deal will appear differentiated with an orange icon that means "Awaiting approval."

<ThemedImage
    alt="Offers Pending"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/providers-guide/offers-pending-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/providers-guide/offers-pending-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Keep in mind that if you delay accepting the deal, the customer may reject it and give you a bad reputation.
