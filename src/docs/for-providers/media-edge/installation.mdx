This guide will walk you through the process of installing Media Edge on your servers. Media Edge is a software package that allows you to participate in Media Network as a provider. It enables you to monetize your resources by offering content delivery services to clients who need to distribute their web content efficiently and effectively.

## Prerequisites
**Being registered** as a provider on Media Network is a prerequisite for installing Media Edge. If you haven't registered yet, please visit the [registration page](https://www.media.network/register) to sign up.
You also need at least **two servers with Debian 10 installed**. One server will be used as the origin server, and the other as the edge server. You can have as many origin and edge servers as you want.
