This guide will walk you through the process of installing Media Edge on your servers. Media Edge is a software package that allows you to participate in Media Network as a provider. It enables you to monetize your resources by offering content delivery services to clients who need to distribute their web content efficiently and effectively.

## Prerequisites

**Being registered** as a provider on Media Network is a prerequisite for installing Media Edge. If you haven't registered yet, please visit the [registration page](https://www.media.network/register) to sign up.
You also need at least **two servers with Debian 10 installed**. One server will be used as the origin server, and the other as the edge server. You can have as many origin and edge servers as you want.

## Step by Step Guide

Ensure these are installed on your local computer and target server(s):

- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-specific-operating-systems)
- [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/)
- [Debian 10 x64](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/debian-installer/)

üñ•Ô∏è For Windows users: it is recommended to install **Debian** for the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** from the **Microsoft Store**. This will allow for greater efficiency in installing Ansible, rsync, and typing commands.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository and its submodules:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mediafoundation/media-edge.git
   cd media-edge
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```
2. Navigate to the `ansible` folder:
   ```sh
   cd ansible
   ```
3. Prepare the hosts file:

   Rename **`hosts.example`** to **`hosts`**.

   <Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
     <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

      ```sh
      copy hosts.example hosts
      ```

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

      ```sh
      cp hosts.example hosts
      ```

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

      ```sh
      cp hosts.example hosts
      ```

     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   The **`hosts`** file is used in Ansible for defining groups of hosts and their connection details. Below is an example of how you can structure your **`hosts`** file to manage multiple servers, categorized as **`origin`** and **`edge`**.

   ```ini
   [origin]
   origin1 ansible_host=XXX.XX.XXX.XX ansible_port=22 ansible_user=root

   [edge]
   edge1 ansible_host=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX ansible_port=22 ansible_user=root
   ```

   Replace X with your server's IP addresses.

   ### Explanation

   1. **Groups ([origin], [edge])**
         - Groups are defined within square brackets ([]). Each group can contain one or more servers with similar roles or configurations.

   2. **Host Definitions**
         - Each host entry starts with a unique name (**origin1**, **edge1**) that identifies the server.
         - **ansible_host:** specifies the IP address or hostname of the server.
         - **ansible_port:** specifies the SSH port number used for Ansible connections (default is 22).
         - **ansible_user:** specifies the username used for SSH authentication (often root for administrative tasks).

   2. **Usage Tips**
         - **Adding more hosts:** you can add additional hosts to either **[origin]** or **[edge]** groups by following the same format.
         - **Dynamic Inventory:** for larger setups, consider using dynamic inventory scripts to automatically populate the **hosts** file based on cloud providers, databases, or other external sources.


 4. Set up your configuration:

   Rename **`user_config.yml.example`** to **`user_config.yml`** and follow the steps below to correctly specify the necessary parameters.

   <Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
     <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

      ```sh
      copy user_config.yml.example user_config.yml
      ```

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

      ```sh
      cp user_config.yml.example user_config.yml
      ```

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

      ```sh
      cp user_config.yml.example user_config.yml
      ```

     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   ### Detailed Steps
   
      1. **Wallet Address**
         - Specify your wallet address within double quotes to avoid it being interpreted as a hex number.
         - Example:
         ```yaml
         wallet_address: "0x00f420693607b8079432296d2E34eb8a9dDC6e7B"
         ```

      2. **Private Key**
         - Provide the private key for decrypting resources. Ensure it's 64 characters long.
         - **Caution:** Use a private key from a wallet without funds to prevent hacking and fund loss.
         - Example:
         ```yaml
         private_key: 545cdcd19de92805371d9644fa7d5a154e51204e41c8cbc8ff3bc9fdd5083efd
         ```

      3. **Networks**
         - Specify the networks where you are providing services, including the network ID and URL. You can find the Network ID in the DAPP in the navigation menu under "More" -> "Contract Addresses" or directly access it at /info.
         - If URL is undefined, the default RPC from the media-sdk will be used.
         - Example:
         ```yaml
         networks:
         - id: 11155111
            URL: undefined
         ```

      4. **Marketplace ID**
         - Select the marketplace ID where you are providing services.
         - Example:
         ```yaml
         marketplace_id: 1
         ```

      5. **Origin IP Address and CNAME**
         - Specify the IP address and CNAME for your origin.
         - Example:
         ```yaml
         origin_ip: 162.33.178.37
         cname: cname.yourdomain.com
         ```

      6. **DNS Configuration**
         - Configure DNS for caddy to create TXT records to pass ACME challenges.
         - Specify the DNS provider and environment variables for authentication.
         - Example:
         ```yaml
         dns_config: 
            lego: cloudflare 
            env_vars: 
            - CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=example@yourmail.com
            - CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
            domains: 
            - yourdomain.com
         ```

      7. **PostgreSQL Configuration**
         - Provide the PostgreSQL database connection details including host, port, user, password, and database name.
         - Example:
         ```yaml
         db_host: localhost
         db_port: 5432
         db_user: origin
         db_password: xxxxxxxxxx
         db_name: origin
         ```

      8. **Testing Server Configuration**
         - If testing is enabled, provision the server with Ganache.
         - Example:
         ```yaml
         testing: false
         ```

      9. **Ganache Configuration**
         - Configure Ganache if testing is true. Set up the host, port, mnemonic, network ID, and chain ID.
         - Example:
         ```yaml
         persist_ganache_db: true
         ganache_host: 0.0.0.0
         ganache_port: 8545
         ganache_mnemonic: "blue stone rain outer bomb like lounge spoil stuff prison shoe own"
         ganache_network_id: 418
         ganache_chain_id: 418
         ```

5. Deploy Media Edge:

   Execute the playbook using the **`ansible-playbook`** command, specifying your **`deploy.yml`** and **`hosts`** file:

   ```sh
   ansible-playbook deploy.yml -i hosts
   ```

   This command initiates Ansible to connect to the specified hosts and execute the tasks defined in **`deploy.yml`**.

By following these steps, you can effectively deploy and manage your media edge infrastructure using Ansible, ensuring consistency and reliability across your distributed network.

Feel free to adjust the instructions based on your specific deployment requirements and infrastructure setup.
