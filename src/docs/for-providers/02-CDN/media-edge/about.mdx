Media Edge is an open-source software designed to help CDN Providers integrate their infrastructure with Media Network. It serves as both a web server and a blockchain resource manager, streamlining the establishment of a CDN network and facilitating interaction with clients.

### Overview

Media Edge empowers CDN Providers by enabling them to list their server capacity on the Media Network marketplace and earn MEDIA tokens in return for their services. This seamless integration allows clients to access your web services while providing real-time analytics, monitoring, and reporting features for efficient cloud management.

### Key Features

- **Effortless CDN Creation & Setup:** Media Edge simplifies setting up a CDN network, allowing providers to join the decentralized marketplace effortlessly.

- **Easy Gateway to a Decentralized CDN Marketplace:** Providers can easily offer their CDN services within the Media Network marketplace and earn MEDIA rewards.

### Benefits for CDN Providers

Media Edge offers the following benefits for CDN Providers:

1. **Access to Media Network Marketplace:** Providers can connect their infrastructure to Media Network, expanding their reach and visibility to potential clients.

2. **Earning MEDIA Tokens:** By offering services on the marketplace, providers receive MEDIA token payments in a secure and transparent manner.

3. **Real-time Analytics and Monitoring:** The software provides comprehensive analytics and monitoring tools, enabling efficient management of CDN networks.

4. **Simplified Billing and User Management:** With Media Edge, CDN Providers no longer need to worry about billing or user management. Everything is managed through the blockchain, ensuring transparent and automated payment processes. Providers can focus on delivering quality services while leaving the administrative tasks to the secure and reliable blockchain infrastructure.

### How It Works

Media Edge integrates seamlessly with Media Network, leveraging the power of blockchain technology to handle billing and user management. When CDN Providers list their server capacity on the marketplace, clients can access their services and pay with MEDIA tokens. The smart contracts on the blockchain handle the entire payment process, ensuring secure and tamper-proof transactions.

By removing the need for manual billing and user management, Media Edge streamlines the service delivery process, making it more efficient and hassle-free for providers. Clients can enjoy uninterrupted access to web services, while providers receive fair compensation for their offerings without the burden of administrative overhead.
