Media Cloud is a cutting-edge and permissionless marketplace for web services, built using the Media Network protocol. It offers an alternative to traditional cloud giants like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, empowering users with a seamless, peer-to-peer experience without boundaries.

Operating on public blockchains, Media Cloud ensures reliability and minimizes outages, standing out as a decentralized service. It embraces a permissionless approach, allowing anyone to participate, provide services, and sell them on the platform.

Media Cloud empowers both clients and providers by enabling them to participate in the marketplace, where they can hire and offer services. By promoting censorship resistance, security, and self-custody, Media Cloud thrives as a truly inclusive and innovative marketplace for web services.

### How does Media Cloud compare to traditional cloud companies?

Media Cloud offers a compelling alternative to centralized services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, or Google Cloud. Here's why it stands out as a better option:

- Media Cloud operates on public blockchains, avoiding concentration of power and reducing the risk of outages, unlike centralized services controlled by single entities.

- Media Cloud fosters competition in its decentralized marketplace by allowing anyone to register as a provider and offer services. This leads to better pricing options and incentivizes providers to offer competitive rates, benefiting end-users.

- Utilizing blockchain and smart contracts, Media Cloud ensures a secure and transparent environment for both providers and clients. Automated transactions enhance efficiency and reduce fraud possibilities.

- By offering a decentralized alternative, Media Cloud breaks the dominance of major tech companies in the web services market, promoting diversity, innovation, and improved service quality.
