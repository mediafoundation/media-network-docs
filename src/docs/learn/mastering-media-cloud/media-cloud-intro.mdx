**Media Network is a permissionless peer-to-peer marketplace providing a decentralized alternative to Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.** This innovative platform employs smart contracts to **create a secure environment for providers and clients on a single, unified interface.** By offering access to a wide range of providers, the Media Network marketplace enables these providers to generate additional revenue by making their services available to a larger client base.

At the heart of this marketplace is the CDN services marketplace, representing the first phase of Media Network’s development. The team's expertise in CDN services is evident in the platform's intricate and comprehensive structure. However, Media Network’s ambitions extend far beyond CDNs. **The marketplace was initially designed for CDN services and has been thoughtfully crafted for adaptability to accommodate other web services in the long term.** This includes Virtual Private Servers (VPS), dedicated servers, databases, cloud computing, and more, all integrated into a single platform that leverages the advantages of decentralization.

### Why have we built a marketplace?

Media Network marketplace for web services offers a centralized platform that facilitates direct and efficient transactions between providers and clients. It promotes competition, diversity, and innovation by providing clients with a wide range of service options. 

The marketplace enables seamless scalability for providers and clients, expanding their reach and meeting growing demands. With decentralized principles and secure smart contracts, Media Network fosters trust and transparency in transactions, benefiting both providers and clients.
