A Media Cloud Provider is any individual or company willing to offer their unused bandwidth and infrastructure, such as servers or high-performance personal computers, on the Media Cloud marketplace. They contribute to a decentralized marketplace, monetizing their resources by providing critical web services.

#### How Does Media Cloud Empower Providers?

Media Cloud is designed with features that cater specifically to providers' needs:
