### Market Offer Discovery

Here you'll find a list of offers originating from registered providers on your active blockchain. Please note that anyone can register as a provider, and thus, the accuracy of the descriptions for the offers presented here can't be guaranteed. The claimed features should ideally correspond with the actual providers but are not stringently monitored or enforced.

### How to take an offer?

In order you take an offer, you must first set up a [CDN Resource](/for-clients/CDN/cdn-resources). Once you have created a resource, you can select any available offers from the marketplace and continue to shop with your cart by assigning the created resource to it.
