### Media PeerPool Demo

Click <a href="https://mediaserver.express/v/UTu3r2Bm" target="_blank">here</a> to open in a new window.  Try opening multiple tabs with the same stream, navigate through them, and observe how the P2P network gradually takes over the data transfer. After a few minutes, you will notice a significant reduction in the CDN usage as the Media PeerPool technology offloads network traffic to the P2P network. This leads to a better user experience by improving streaming quality and reducing latency.

### Integration


Since PeerPool only requires Javascript, integrating it into your website is seamless for end-users and only requires a minor modification to your site's HTML page.

The client-side integration will depend on the player you are using and typically involves adding just a single line of code to your page. To achieve this, include the following scripts in the head section of your player's page:
```html
<script src="https://media.network/demo/peerpool.js"></script>
```

### Complete Example (Clappr)

```html

<style>body{margin:0}#video{width:100vw;height:100vh;}</style>
<div id="video"></div>
<script src="https://media.network/demo/peerpool.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/clappr@latest"></script>
<script>
  if (p2pml.hlsjs.Engine.isSupported()) {
    var engine = new p2pml.hlsjs.Engine();
    var loader = engine.createLoaderClass();
  } else {
    var loader = XHRLoader;
  }
  var engine = new p2pml.hlsjs.Engine();
  var player = new Clappr.Player({
    parentId: "#video",
    source: "https://client123.cdnprovider.com/live/STREAM_NAME/index.m3u8",
    width:"100%",
    height:"100%",
    playback: {
      hlsjsConfig: {
        liveSyncDurationCount: 7,
        loader: loader
      }
    }
  });
  if (p2pml.hlsjs.Engine.isSupported()) p2pml.hlsjs.initClapprPlayer(player);
  player.play(true);
</script>
