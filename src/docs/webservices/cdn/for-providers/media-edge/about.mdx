### Media Edge, and Media Guard
Media Edge and Media Guard were previously two different software programs operated separately. However, they are now merging into one software called Media Edge. This new software is optional, meaning that providers do not have to use it if they don‚Äôt want to; providers can select their software (for example, nginx instead of Caddy) as long as it meets the requirements of the Media Network smart contracts.
