Click <a href="https://mediaserver.express/v/UTu3r2Bm" target="_blank">here</a> to open in a new window.  Try opening multiple tabs with the same stream, navigate through them, and observe how the P2P network gradually takes over the data transfer. After a few minutes, you will notice a significant reduction in the CDN usage as the Media PeerPool technology offloads network traffic to the P2P network. This leads to a better user experience by improving streaming quality and reducing latency.
